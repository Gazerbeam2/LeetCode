# Title: 226. Invert Binary Tree

## Description: Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree and return its root.

### Explanation:

First we check if the tree is empty as a base case, then we create a brand new Tree by giving the new node the same value as the original node and using recursion, build out the tree in reverse order.
